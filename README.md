About Dataset 
The Customer Support Ticket Dataset is a dataset that includes customer support tickets for various tech products. It consists of customer inquiries related to hardware issues, software bugs, network problems, account access, data loss, and other support topics. The dataset provides information about the customer, the product purchased, the ticket type, the ticket channel, the ticket status, and other relevant 
details. 
The dataset can be used for various analysis and modelling tasks in the customer service domain. 
Features Description: 
●	Ticket ID: A unique identifier for each ticket. 
Customer Name: The name of the customer who raised the ticket. 
●	Customer Email: The email address of the customer (Domain name @example.com is intentional for user data privacy concern). 
●	Customer Age: The age of the customer. 
●	Customer Gender: The gender of the customer. 
●	Product Purchased: The tech product purchased by the customer. 
●	Date of Purchase: The date when the product was purchased. 
●	Ticket Type: The type of ticket (e.g., technical issue, billing inquiry, product inquiry). 
●	Ticket Subject: The subject/topic of the ticket. 
●	Ticket Description: The description of the customer's issue or inquiry. 
●	Ticket Status: The status of the ticket (e.g., open, closed, pending customer response). 
●	Resolution: The resolution or solution provided for closed tickets. 
●	Ticket Priority: The priority level assigned to the ticket (e.g., low, medium, high, 
critical). 
●	Ticket Channel: The channel through which the ticket was raised (e.g., email, phone, chat, social media). 
●	First Response Time: The time taken to provide the first response to the customer. 
●	Time to Resolution: The time taken to resolve the ticket. 
●	Customer Satisfaction Rating: The customer's satisfaction rating for closed tickets (on a scale of 1 to 5). 
Use Cases of such dataset: 
Customer Support Analysis: The dataset can be used to analyze customer support ticket trends, identify common issues, and improve support processes. 
●	Natural Language Processing (NLP): The ticket descriptions can be used for training NLP models to automate ticket categorization or sentiment analysis. 
●	Customer Satisfaction Prediction: The dataset can be used to train models to predict customer satisfaction based on ticket information. 
●	Ticket Resolution Time Prediction: The dataset can be used to build models for predicting the time it takes to resolve a ticket based on various factors. 
●	Customer Segmentation: The dataset can be used to segment customers based on their ticket types, issues, or satisfaction levels. 
●	Recommender Systems: The dataset can be used to build recommendation systems for suggesting relevant solutions or products based on customer 
inquiries.

Customer Satisfaction Prediction Machine Learning Project 
Project Overview 
The goal of this project is to predict customer satisfaction using historical data. This involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze factors that influence customer satisfaction and build a predictive model. 
Dataset 
A commonly used dataset for this type of project is the "Customer Satisfaction Survey" dataset, which includes features such as: 
●	CustomerID 
Age 
●	Gender 
●	Income 
●	Education Level 
●	Product Purchased 
●	Purchase Frequency 
●	Customer Service Interactions 
●	Feedback Scores 
●	Overall Satisfaction 
This dataset can be found on platforms like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
Steps and Implementation 
1.	Data Preprocessing 
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
3.	Feature Engineering 
4.	Model Building 
5.	Model Evaluation 
6.	Visualization 
Implementation Code 
Here is a sample implementation in Python: 
 
# Importing necessary libraries import pandas as pd import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix 
# Load the dataset data = pd.read_csv('customer_satisfaction.csv') 
# Display basic info about the dataset print(data.info()) 
# Data Preprocessing # Handling missing values data = data.dropna() 
# Encoding categorical variables    label_encoders = {} for column in 
data.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns: label_encoders[column] = LabelEncoder() data[column] = label_encoders[column].fit_transform(data[column]) 
# Define features and target variable 
X = data.drop(['CustomerID', 'Overall Satisfaction'], axis=1) y = data['Overall Satisfaction'] # Splitting the dataset 
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42) 
# Feature Scaling scaler 
= StandardScaler() 
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train) 
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test) 
# Model Building 
# Train a Random Forest Classifier rfc = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42) 
rfc.fit(X_train, y_train) 
# Predict on the test set y_pred = rfc.predict(X_test) 
# Model Evaluation print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)) print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test,y_ pred)) 
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)) 
# Visualization of Results # Feature Importance feature_importances = pd.Series(rfc.feature_importan ces_, index=X.columns) feature_importances.nlargest(

Explanation of Code 
1.	Data Preprocessing: 
○	Load the dataset and display basic information. 
	 	○ Handle missing values by dropping rows with NA values. 
	 	○ Encode categorical variables using LabelEncoder. 
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
○	Although not shown in the code snippet, EDA typically involves visualizing data distributions, correlations, and patterns using libraries like 
matplotlib and seaborn. 
3.	Feature Engineering: 
○	Define the feature set X and the target variable y. 
	 	○ Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split. 
4.	Feature Scaling: 
○	Standardize the features using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally to the model. 
5.	Model Building: 
○	Train a RandomForestClassifier on the training data. 
	 	○ Predict customer satisfaction on the test data. 
6.	Model Evaluation: 
○	Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, classification report, and 
confusion matrix. 
○ Visualize the top 10 feature importances to understand which factors 
contribute most to customer satisfaction.
